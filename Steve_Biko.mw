Biko and SASO were openly critical of NUSAS' protests against government policies.

During his ban, Biko asked for a meeting with Donald Woods, the white liberal editor of the ''Daily Dispatch''. Under Woods' editorship, the newspaper had published articles criticising apartheid and the white-minority regime and had also given space to the views of various black groups, but not the BCM. Biko hoped to convince Woods to give the movement greater coverage and an outlet for its views.[./Steve_Biko#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWoods197855-118 <span class="mw-reflink-text"><nowiki>[118]</nowiki></span>]{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=55}} Woods was initially reticent, believing that Biko and the BCM advocated anti-white racism.[./Steve_Biko#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWoods197845.2C_48-119 <span class="mw-reflink-text"><nowiki>[119]</nowiki></span>]{{sfn|Woods|1978|pp=45, 48}} When he met Biko for the first time, Woods expressed his concern about the anti-white liberal sentiment of Biko's early writings.
