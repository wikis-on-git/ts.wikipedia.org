This universal humanity, however, was predicated (and still is) on the dualism of the flesh and the spirit, such that while the body is particular, marked through practice as Jew or Greek, and through anatomy as male or female, the spirit is universal. Paul did not, however, reject the body—as did, for instance, the gnostics—but rather promoted a system whereby the body had its place, albeit subordinated to the spirit. Paul's anthropological dualism was matched by a hermeneutical dualism as well. Just as the human being is divided into a fleshy and a spiritual component, so also is language itself. It is composed of outer, material signs and inner, spiritual significations. When this is applied to the religious system that Paul inherited, the physical, fleshy signs of the Torah, of historical Judaism, are re-interpreted as symbols of that which Paul takes to be universal requirements and possibilities for humanity. }}</ref>  <ref name="A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity10">{{cite book |last = Boyarin |first = Daniel |title = A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity |year= 1994 |publisher = University of California Press |location = Berkeley, California |isbn = 0-520-08592-2 |chapter = Answering the Mail |chapterurl = http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft7w10086w&chunk.id=ch10&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ch10&brand=ucpress |quote = Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension with one another. }}</ref>  <ref name="Britannica Online Encyclopedia: Bet Din">{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/63134/bet-din |title=Britannica Online Encyclopedia: Bet Din |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>  <ref name="Conservative Judaism">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewlicious.com/2005/06/conservative-judaism/ |title=Conservative Judaism |publisher=Jewlicious |quote=We therefore understand this term as a metaphor to mean that the Torah is divine and that it reflects God's will.}}</ref>  <ref name="Ethnoreligious">See, for example, [[Deborah Dash Moore]], ''American Jewish Identity Politics'', [[University of Michigan Press]], 2008, p.&nbsp;303; Ewa Morawska, ''Insecure Prosperity: Small-Town Jews in Industrial America, 1890–1940'', [[Princeton University Press]], 1999. p.&nbsp;217; Peter Y.

The rise of Messianic Judaism was, in many ways, a logical outcome of the ideology and rhetoric of the movement to evangelize the Jews as well as its early sponsorship of various forms of Hebrew Christian expressions. The missions have promoted the message that Jews who had embraced Christianity were not betraying their heritage or even their faith but were actually fulfilling their true Jewish selves by becoming Christians. The missions also promoted the dispensationalist idea that the Church equals the body of the true Christian believers and that Christians were defined by their acceptance of Jesus as their personal Savior and not by their affiliations with specific denominations and particular liturgies or modes of prayer. Missions had been using Jewish symbols in their buildings and literature and called their centers by Hebrew names such as Emanuel or Beth Sar Shalom. Similarly, the missions' publications featured Jewish religious symbols and practices such as the lighting of a menorah. Although missionaries to the Jews were alarmed when they first confronted the more assertive and independent movement of Messianic Judaism, it was they who were responsible for its conception and indirectly for its birth. The ideology, rhetoric, and symbols they had promoted for generations provided the background for the rise of a new movement that missionaries at first rejected as going too far but later accepted and even embraced. }}</ref> <ref name="Ariel2006p191a">{{cite book |last = Ariel |first = Yaakov<!--''not'' the Yaakov Ariel with a Wikipedia entry--> |editor1-last=Gallagher |editor1-first=Eugene V. |editor2-last=Ashcraft |editor2-first=W.

Missionaries such as the Southern Baptist Robert Lindsey noted that for Israeli Jews, the term ''nozrim'', "Christians" in Hebrew, meant, almost automatically, an alien, hostile religion. Because such a term made it nearly impossible to convince Jews that Christianity was their religion, missionaries sought a more neutral term, one that did not arouse negative feelings. They chose ''Meshichyim'', Messianic, to overcome the suspicion and antagonism of the term ''nozrim''. ''Meshichyim'' as a term also had the advantage of emphasizing messianism as a major component of the Christian evangelical belief that the missions and communities of Jewish converts to Christianity propagated. It conveyed the sense of a new, innovative religion rather that''{{sic}}'' an old, unfavorable one. The term was used in reference to those Jews who accepted Jesus as their personal savior, and did not apply to Jews accepting Roman Catholicism who in Israel have called themselves Hebrew Christians. The term Messianic Judaism was adopted in the United States in the early 1970s by those converts to evangelical Christianity who advocated a more assertive attitude on the part of converts towards their Jewish roots and heritage. |lccn = 2006022954}}</ref> <ref name="Denominations"> ;[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] :{{cite web  |url=http://www.aish.com/jw/s/48892792.html   |title=Why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus   |accessdate=28 July 2010   |last=Simmons   |first=Shraga   |publisher=[[Aish HaTorah]]   |quote=Jews do not accept Jesus as the messiah because:<br />#Jesus did not fulfill the messianic prophecies. #Jesus did not embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah. #Biblical verses "referring" to Jesus are mistranslations. #Jewish belief is based on national revelation.  }} ;[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]:{{cite web  |url=http://www.uscj.org/Messianic_Jews_Not_J5480.html   |title=Messianic Jews Are Not Jews   |accessdate=2007-02-14   |last=Waxman   |first=Jonathan   |year=2006   |publisher=[[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]]   |quote=Hebrew Christian, Jewish Christian, Jew for Jesus, Messianic Jew, Fulfilled Jew.

Without first accepting Yeshua as the King and thus obeying Him, then getting circumcised for the purpose of Jewish conversion only gains you access to the Jewish community. It means nothing when it comes to inheriting a place in the World to Come.... Getting circumcised apart from desiring to be obedient to HaShem, and apart from accepting Yeshua as your King, is nothing but a surgical procedure, or worse, could lead to you believe that Jewish identity grants you a portion in the World to Come – at which point, what good is Messiah Yeshua, the Word of HaShem to you? He would have died for nothing!... As a convert from the nations, part of your obligation in keeping the Covenant, if you are a male, is to get circumcised in fulfillment of the commandment regarding circumcision. Circumcision is not an absolute requirement of being a Covenant member (that is, being made righteous before HaShem, and thus obtaining eternal life), but it is a requirement of obedience to God's commandments, because circumcision is commanded for those who are of the seed of Abraham, whether born into the family, adopted, or converted....If after reading all of this you understand what circumcision is, and that is an act of obedience, rather than an act of gaining favor before HaShem for the purpose of receiving eternal life, then if you are male believer in Yeshua the Messiah for the redemption from death, the consequence of your sin of rebellion against Him, then pursue circumcision, and thus conversion into Judaism, as an act of obedience to the Messiah. }}</ref> <ref name="Meltonp373a">[[J.
