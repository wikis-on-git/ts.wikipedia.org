==Matimu==
Bennet Keats Mpilele Mtombeni, the first born son of Nyavana, son of 
Mugimeti, was born on the 14th December, 1926 at Burgersdorp in the 
T zaneen district. 

He started school in 1936 at the Shilubana Primary School, where he passed 
Standard 6. Thereafter, he proceeded to Johannesburg to seek employment. 
He struggled and worked at several places. Owing to the fact that he knew 
that without education, nothing could succeed, he incessantly engaged himself 
in private studies. Fortunately, his efforts were rewarded. He managed to 
complete the Junior Certificate Examinations through correspondence. After 
a short period of time, he passed his Matriculation Examinations, which opened 
the way for his B.A. degree studies. At the time of his death, he had already 
passed sixteen courses towards the completion of his degree with the 
University of South Africa, but owing to a disjunction between his subject 
combinations and prescribed curriculum of the degree, he failed to satisfy the 
requirements for a B.A. degree. 

=== 1950 - 1976: ===
In 1950 at the age of twenty-four, Mpilele Mtombeni joined the South African 
Railways and Harbours as a policeman. In 1960 he took up employment at the 
University of South Africa. He worked here for a period of two years as a 
messenger. From 1963 to 1971 he was in the employ of the South African Milk 
Board. Because of his involvement in community development and his 
enthusiasm to improve the quality of life and the status of the Tsonga people 
in the urban areas, the Gazankulu Government appointed him as the first 
Urban Representative for the Tsonga/ Shangaan people. In the beginning, he 
did not have offices and he operated from his house in Atteridgeville. Later he 
worked from the Gazankulu offices next to the Saulsville cemetery. 

In 1972 he started writing articles for Nh/uvuko, a monthly journal of the 
Department of Information. He became a regular and popular contributor until 
his death in 1976. He wrote with the main objective of conscientizing the 
Tsonga/Shangaan people in the urban areas to stand up and be counted 
amongst the other racial groups. He became known as the Nhlalala ya 
madoroba (A honey-guide - bird), because of his qualities of leadership. 

Mtombeni was a staunch member of the Bureau for Tsonga Language and 
Culture. He was the Chairman of the Book Committee and an active Executive 
Member. We believe that his association with this organization was a strong 
factor in his love of writing. 

=== Rifu na kutsundzukiwa: ===
On the 3rd May, 1976 at the age of 50 years, Mtombeni died at Tembisa 
Hospital after a short illness. He died fourteen days after the death of his first 
born son, Floyd, who drowned in the Crocodile River. They were buried on the 
same day, after a funeral service at the Atteridgeville Community Hall. This 
tragedy affected many urban dwellers and the whole Gazankulu community. 
The Gazankulu Government was represented by the late Chief Minister: Prof. 
Ntswan'wisi. This occasion accorded him the chance to pay homage to 
Mtombeni's creative works.
