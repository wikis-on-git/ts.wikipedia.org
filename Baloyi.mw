Valoyi / Baloyi, belong to the big family of Vanyayi! They are descendants of Gulukhulu, son of Changa son of Mutota who became known as Changamire (imire meaning ruler in Arabic). Mutota is the second Mwenemutapa after the pioneer Matope. Mutota was a son of Matope. The royal Mwenemutapas including the Changamires are Vanyayi. We are the royal descendants of Gulukhulu through Hwambi or Gwambe who became known as Valoyi (after he married his aunt hahani) by his elder brother Xirimbi who was in power after Gulukhulu passed on. Baloyi or Valoyi is Munyayi and the greatgrand son of Banyayi. Vanyayi are found amongst various language group speakers and are all of royality. All BaVhenda - speaking Vanyayi are descendants of Gulukhulu. Since Vanyayi is a great family, which is not only limited to Changamire royal house but is found also under Mwenemutapas royal house, all Vanyayis are related through the Mwenemutaps. Vanyayis are spread in Southern African countries that includes, South Africa (Baperi, Basotho, VhaVenda, Balovedu, Vatsonga), Zimbabwe (Kalanga famous royal families of Changamire and Mwenemutapa), Zambia (Ba Lozi), Botswana (Banyayi, Balozi)and Namibia (BaLozi)http://bakalanga-banyai.blogspot.com/. 

Vanyayis have been nicknamed Varwozwi / Lozwi which means destroyers during the 1600 when Changamire Dombo attacked the Portuguese in Zimbabwe and was able to drive them away from Zimbabwe into Mozambique. The first African to defeat the Europeans effectively. 

Vanyayi are also known as Vacopi in Mozambique. The name is derived from their bow and arrow fighting tactics (Copa means to shoot with an arrow), that killed a lot of Ngoni (Zulu) warriors with their bow and arrows. Famous Copi surnames are Valoyi or Baloyi, from Kalanga land in Zimbabwe, yet other historian’s claim Valoyi (Gwambe) is from Thovela, land of Modjadji. Junod states, Gwambe or Valoyi (known today) tribe, Gwambe people originate from Zimbabwe (Kalanga Land) and Modjadji land.
