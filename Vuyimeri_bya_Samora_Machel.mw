The area which made up the constituency was named Wanaheda during colonial times and continued to be called it following its independence in 1990. It is an acronym for ''''Wa'''mbos, '''Na'''mas, '''He'''reros and '''Da'''maras', the four peoples that were living here. In 2003, following governmental and public recommendations, it was renamed in honour of [[Muzambhiki|Mozambican]] President Samora Machel.<ref>[http://www.namibian.com.na/2008/August/national/0823599E15.html Constituency named after John Pandeni] in [//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Namibian The Namibian], 27 August 2008</ref>
