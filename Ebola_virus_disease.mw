'''Ebola virus disease''' ('''EVD''') or '''Ebola hemorrhagic fever''' ('''EHF''') is the human disease caused by the [[Ebola virus]].<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> Symptoms typically start two days to three weeks after contracting the virus, with a [[fever]], sore throat, [[Myalgia|muscle pains]], and [[headaches]].<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> Typically [[nausea]], vomiting, and [[diarrhea]] follow, along with decreased functioning of the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s.<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> At this point, some people begin to have [[bleeding]] problems.<ref name=WHO2014>{{cite web|title=Ebola virus disease  Fact sheet N°103|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=12 April 2014|date=March 2014}}</ref>

<!-- Cause and Diagnosis-->
The virus may be acquired upon contact with [[blood]] or [[bodily fluid]]s of an infected animal (commonly monkeys or [[fruit bat]]s).<ref name=WHO2014/> Spread through the air has not been documented in the natural environment.<ref name=WHOAir2014>{{cite web|title=2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa|url=http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140421/en/|website=WHO|accessdate=3 August 2014|date=Apr 21 2014}}</ref> Fruit bats are believed to carry and spread the virus without being affected.<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> Once human infection occurs, the disease may spread between people as well.<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> Male survivors may be able to transmit the disease via [[semen]] for nearly two months.<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> In order to make the diagnosis, typically other diseases with similar symptoms such as [[malaria]], [[cholera]] and other [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s are first excluded.<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> To confirm the diagnosis blood samples are  tested for viral [[antibodies]], viral [[RNA]], or the virus itself.<ref name=WHO2014/>

<!-- Prevention -->
Prevention includes decreasing the spread of disease from infected monkeys and pigs to humans.<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> This may be done by checking such animals for infection and killing and properly disposing of the bodies if the disease is discovered.<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> Properly cooking meat and wearing protective clothing when handling meat may also be helpful,<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> as are wearing protective clothing and [[washing hands]] when around a person with the disease.<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> --> Samples of bodily fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution.<ref name=WHO2014/>

<!-- Treatment, Prognosis and Epidemiology-->  
There is no specific treatment for the disease; efforts to help persons who are infected include giving either [[oral rehydration therapy]] (slightly sweet and salty water to drink) or [[intravenous fluids]].<ref name=WHO2014/> The disease has high [[mortality rate]]: often killing between 50% and 90% of those infected with the virus.<ref name=WHO2014/><ref name="Elsevier/Academic Press">{{cite book|author1=C.M.
